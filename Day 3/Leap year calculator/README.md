# Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. 

### Every year that is evenly divisible by 4 is a leap year.

### Example
### The year 2000:

1. 2000 รท 4 = 500 (Leap)

### So the year 2000 is a leap year.


#### Hint:
#### Use mod operator to check if it is fully divisible or not
