# You need to write a function that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.



### Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by themselves and 1.

##  Example:    1
### Input:  73
### Output: It's a prime number.

##  Example:    2
### Input:  46
### Output: It's not a prime number.
