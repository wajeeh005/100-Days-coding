# write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

1.  Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

2.  When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

3.  When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`

4.  And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"
