So, we are doing this for TESLA stock.
1. You can go to [TESLE](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-TSLA/) for viewing the overwiew of Tesla stocks.
2. For getting Stock API you have to go on [alphavantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) and generate and API 
3. Then go to [Documentation](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) to understand what parameters and how to used Api.
4. We also need a NEWS API for getting news related to our Stock name for this I used [newsapi](https://newsapi.org/).
5. And in the End used [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)

### The code for this break down into 9 steps.
1. Get yesterday's closing stock price.  

    **Hint:** You can perform list comprehensions on Python dictionaries. e.g. [new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]
  

2. Get the day before yesterday's closing stock price.  


3. Find the positive difference between 1 and 2. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.  
**Hint:** https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp  


4. Work out the percentage difference in price between closing price yesterday and closing price the day before yesterday.  


7. If difference percentage is greater than 5 use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.
  

8. Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles.  
**Hint:** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation.
  

9. Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.
  

10. Send each article as a separate message via Twilio.
  

11. Format the message like this:

        
        
        TSLA: ðŸ”º2%
        Headline: Were Hedge Funds Right About Piling Into Tesla Inc. (TSLA)?.

        or

### Note:
All the steps are working perfectly but the step 10 in which we have to acces Twilio for SMS services is not work here due to i have no access to this account if you have then you just put you credential in code and it will work.
