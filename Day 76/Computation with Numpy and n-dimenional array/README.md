In this we explore numpy , dimensions, mathimatical operation on array.


How to leverage the power ðŸ’ª of NumPy's ndarrays.

How to access individual values and subsets inside an n-dimensional array, line space , matrix multiplication and image manipulation.

## Following things learned after doing this
