#### What we do ?

1. Combine the groupby() and count() functions to aggregate data

2. Use the .value_counts() function

3. Slice DataFrames using the square bracket notation e.g., df[:-2] or df[:10]

4. Use the .agg() function to run an operation on a particular column

5. rename() columns of DataFrames

6. Create a line chart with two separate axes to visualise data that have different scales.

7. Create a scatter plot in Matplotlib

8. .merge() DataFrames along a particular column

9. Create a bar chart with Matplotlib
