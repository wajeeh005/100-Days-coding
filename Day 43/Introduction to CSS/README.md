# Introduction to CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen.
It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.  
It is used to set the style in web pages that contain HTML elements. It sets the background color, font-size, font-family, color, … etc property of elements on a web page.

2. Internal CSS
3. External CSS

### Internal CSS: 
This can be used when a single HTML document must be styled uniquely. 
The CSS rule set should be within the HTML file in the head section 
i.e the CSS is embedded within the HTML file.

### External CSS: 
External CSS contains separate CSS file which contains only style property with the help of tag attributes 
(For example class, id, heading, … etc). CSS property written in a separate file with .css extension 
and should be linked to the HTML document using link tag.
This means that for each element, style can be set only once and that will be applied across web pages.
