# What we do?

1. Use nested loops to remove unwanted characters from multiple columns

2. Filter Pandas DataFrames based on multiple conditions using both .loc[] and .query()

3. Create bubble charts using the Seaborn Library

4. Style Seaborn charts using the pre-built styles and by modifying Matplotlib parameters

5. Use floor division (i.e., integer division) to convert years to decades

6. Use Seaborn to superimpose a linear regressions over our data

7. Make a judgement if our regression is good or bad based on how well the model fits our data and the r-squared metric

8. Run regressions with scikit-learn and calculate the coefficients.
